## Overview  
Uncertain knowledge graphs (UKGs), which associate each triple with a confidence score, enable more reliable knowledge completion and uncertainty-aware reasoning compared to deterministic knowledge graphs. However, heterogeneous implementations, diverse programming languages, and inconsistent evaluation settings of existing uncertain knowledge graph embedding (UKGE) methods hinder fair comparison and practical adoption.

**OpenUKGE** addresses these challenges by providing a unified, reproducible Python framework for UKGE research, supporting standardized model implementation, dataset integration, and evaluation protocols.

## Key Features  
- Support embedding of uncertain knowledge graphs: triples of the form (h,‚ÄØr,‚ÄØt,‚ÄØconfidence)  
- Supports multiple embedding models implemented in Python under one unified API  
- Integrates benchmark UKG datasets for knowledge completion and confidence estimation tasks  
- Provides standard and novel evaluation protocols for ranking, classification, and confidence prediction  
- Offers reproducibility and extensibility: you can reproduce published results, plug in new models, datasets or metrics  
- Licensed under GPL‚Äë3.0 and designed for research and open‚Äësource usage  

## Installation  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chienking1997/OpenUKGE.git  
cd OpenUKGE  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```

## Quick Start  
1. Prepare your uncertain knowledge graph data: entities, relations, triples and confidence scores.  
2. Modify the example script (`nl27k_UKGE_demo.py`) for your data paths and hyper‚Äëparameters.  
3. Run the demo:  
   ```bash
   python nl27k_UKGE_demo.py
   ```
4. Inspect the outputs: training log, embedding results, evaluation metrics for tasks such as confidence prediction or ranking.
