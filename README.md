## üåç Overview  
Uncertain knowledge graphs (UKGs), which associate each triple with a confidence score, enable more reliable knowledge completion and uncertainty-aware reasoning compared to deterministic knowledge graphs. However, heterogeneous implementations, diverse programming languages, and inconsistent evaluation settings of existing uncertain knowledge graph embedding (UKGE) methods hinder fair comparison and practical adoption.

**OpenUKGE** addresses these challenges by providing a unified, reproducible Python framework for UKGE research, supporting standardized model implementation, dataset integration, and evaluation protocols.

## üß© Key Features  
- **Native UKG Support**: Natively processes quadruples of the form `(head, relation, tail, confidence)`  
- **Unified Model Interface**: Multiple UKGE models with consistent APIs for easy comparison  
- **Benchmark Datasets**: Integrated with standard UKG datasets (cn15k, nl27k, ppi5k, onet20k) and few-shot variants, with automatic download support via `download_dataset` utility  
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Supports confidence prediction (MSE, MAE, ECE), link prediction (MR, MRR, Hit@k), and ranking quality (nDCG) metrics  
- **Advanced Training Utilities**: Includes specialized trainers with semi-supervised learning and few-shot learning support  
- **High Reproducibility**: Standardized experimental pipelines to ensure consistent and comparable results  
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easy to extend with new models, datasets, or evaluation metrics

## üì¶ Installation
### 1. Install PyTorch for your system 
‚öôÔ∏èOpenUKGE depends on PyTorch, but it is not included in the default dependency list. The reason is: 

1. Different hardware configurations require different PyTorch builds.
2. Official recommendation: PyTorch developers advise users to install it manually using the appropriate wheel for their environment.
3. Avoiding compatibility issues: Including PyTorch directly in install_requires often causes failed installations or large downloads on systems without matching CUDA libraries.

Example for torch 2.3.0 + CUDA 12.1:
```bash
pip install torch==2.3.0+cu121 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
```
Example (CPU-only):
```bash
pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
```
### 2. Install OpenUKGE package
+ Install from source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chienking1997/OpenUKGE.git  
cd OpenUKGE  
pip install .
```
+ Install by pypi
```bash
pip install OpenUKGE
```

## üöÄ Quick Start
Take training the UKGE model using the NL27K dataset as an example.  
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Import the required modules
```python
from openukge.data import nl27k
from openukge.models import UKGE
from openukge.training import UKGETrainer, OptimBuilder, EarlyStop
from openukge.loss import UKGELoss
from openukge.utils import seed_everything
```
### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Fix seeds, load data, define model, loss, optimizer & early stopping for modules
```python
seed_everything()
data = nl27k.load_data('data', num_neg=10, batch_size=512)
model = UKGE(data.num_ent, data.num_rel, emb_dim=128)
loss = UKGELoss()
opt = {'optimizer': {'type': 'Adam', 'lr': 0.001}}
optimizer = OptimBuilder(opt)
early_stop = EarlyStop(patience=2, min_delta=0, 
                       monitor="mse", mode="min", 
                       monitor_mode="tail")
```
### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Train and valid the model
```python
trainer = UKGETrainer(data, model, loss, 
                      optimizer, early_stop, 
                      save_path="best_nl27k-mse.pt")
trainer.fit(epochs=100, eval_freq=2)
```
### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Output the comprehensive evaluation results of the model
```python
trainer.test()
```
